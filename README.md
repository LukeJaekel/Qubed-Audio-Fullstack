# Qubed-Audio-Fullstack

A full stack project designed for customers to hire audio equipment for live events.

How it works:

This project features two websites. The main site which contains information about 
the business and the audio rental website which allows customers to hire sound equipment 
and relevant services. Essentially, the rental side fetches data dynamically from an SQL 
database by obtaining "n" number of products. Apart from that, it works like any other 
e-commerce website.

Back-end Software:

This project originally stemmed from a collaboration between me and a friend who had 
designed a stock management system written entirely in VB.NET that links to the same 
database as the website. With the software acting as a "front-end" to the back-end, 
he is able to manage the database easily through a bespoke GUI.
